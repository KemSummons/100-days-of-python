# Fix the Errors
# in next string input have 'string' type, what broke all code
# need switch 'string' type to 'integer' like a - age = int(input("How old are you?"))
age = input("How old are you?")
# next string compares only integers numbers
# in next string we have only one variant for correct code work, is input more 18
# anyone input before or equal 18 will print nothing
if age > 18:
# in next string missing indent expected after 'if:'
# in next string missing 'f' before quotation marks for use variable with help curly brackets
# next string must be like a - print(f"You can drive at age {age}.")
print("You can drive at age {age}.")
